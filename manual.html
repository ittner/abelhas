<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

<p> Abelhas (aka Lua PSO) is a Lua library for particle swarm optimization (PSO), a population-based optimization algorithm inspired by the social behavior of some species, like fishes and birds, and used for solving a multitude of numeric problems with linear and discrete search spaces. The first particle swarm optimization algorithm was invented by Dr. James Kennedy and Russell Eberhart, in 1995, and since then several versions and variants have been created. Abelhas is one of them. </p>

<p> For people familiarized with particle swarms, Abelhas is a particle swarm optimizer that uses global neighborhood, speed limits and particle replacement. It does not have the concept of inertia. </p>

<p> The solver may be seen as being a multi-dimensional solution space, where each dimension gives the value of one variable from the problem. The problem is initialized by randomly placing some number of "particles" (candidate solutions) in this search space. Each particle are ranked with a fitness function and will remember is own best position ("pbest") on the search space and will be able to "see" the best particle in the swarm ("gbest") and accelerate itself towards an intermediate position between its own best position and the position of the best particle in the swarm. This step is repeated for each particle in the swarm until some termination criteria is met (maximum fitness reached, maximum number of iterations or too many iterations without any improvement in the fitness of the best particle of the swarm). When this criterion is met, it is said that the problem converged to a solution. </p>

<p> In order to get the algorithm to work, several parameters must be supplied:</p>
<ul>
 <li> The <strong>number of dimensions</strong> of the problem;  each dimension is a variable to be optimized. </li>
 
 <li> The <strong>fitness function</strong>, a function that receives the variables from the solver and evaluates them, giving a <strong>fitness value</strong>;  Higher values means better solutions. </li>

 <li> The <strong>number of particles</strong> used in the swarm. </li>

 <li> The <strong>limits</strong> of each dimension; or, the maximum and minimum values that may be given to that variable. </li>
 
 <li> The <strong>cognitive and social factors</strong> (c1 and c2) that says how much a particle will trust itself and how much it will trust in the swarm. </li>
 
 <li> The <strong>maximum speed</strong> allowed for each dimension; This parameter tries to avoid the premature convergence of the particles to a local optimum. </li>
 
 <li> The <strong>replacement probability</strong>; that may save the solver from getting stuck in a local optimum by replacing a particle by a random one. </li>
 
 <li> The <strong>termination criteria</strong>, that says when the algorithm will stop and give the solution; This may be the maximum fitness to be reached, the maximum number of iterations or the maximum stagnation (number of iterations without any improvement on the fitness of the best particle of the swarm). </li>
</ul>

<p>More information are available in the section related to the <a href="#api">Abelhas API</a>.</p>

<h2 id="development">Development</h2>

<p>All current development is <a href="https://github.com/ittner/abelhas">done
in GitHub</a>. Code contributions are welcome! Just fork the repository and
send me a pull request or e-mail me a patch.</p>




<h2 id="download">Download, installation and initialization</h2>

<p> Abelhas is a pure-Lua library and can be downloaded from the
<a href="https://github.com/ittner/abelhas/downloads">download page</a>
in GitHub. After downloading, just unpack the distribution package and
copy the file <code>pso.lua</code> to the Lua packages directory in your
system.</p>

<p>Some old tarballs are also
<a href="http://luaforge.net/projects/abelhas/">archived in Luaforge</a> but
all new releases are done in GitHub.</p>

<p>It is also possible to install Abelhas using
<a href="http://luarocks.org">Lua Rocks</a>. If you have LuaRocks installed
in your system, just type <code>luarocks install abelhas</code> in the
shell.</p>

<p>Abelhas uses the Lua 5.1 package system that allows you to simply do a</p>
<pre class="example">local pso = require("pso")</pre>
<p> call to load up the library. </p>

<pre class="example">
local pso = require("pso")

math.randomseed(os.time())      -- Seeds the pseudo-random number generator

local swarm = pso.new(2)        -- Creates a new swarm with 2 dimensions
swarm:setLimits(-3.0, 3.0)      -- Search space
swarm:setParticles(10)          -- 10 particles

swarm:setMaxFitness(1.0)        -- Stops when the maximum fitness is reached
swarm:setMaxStagnation(20)      -- Stops if stalled for 20 generations

swarm:setFitnessFunction(function (x, y)
    return math.cos(x^2 + y^2) - x^2/5 - y^2/5
